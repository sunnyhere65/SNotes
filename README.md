# SNotes
Since it's pandemic time, everybody has to attend their classes online, and taking notes is really exhausting so most of us prefer to take screenshots during the classes and use them as notes. But we also need to organize those screenshots later, which is again a tedious job. So I decided to make a program that does the job for us. Also i'm a newbie at python so my code ain't that good.
 
 You can install the application using the standalone-installer file (SNotes.exe), but it'll be detected as a malware on your pc. I still haven't ofund the way to resolve the issue.
 OR
 1. Clone the repo on your system.
 2. Navigate to the repo folder (SNotes)
 3. Open that folder in the terminal and execute the SNotes.py file by typing the following command - "python SNotes.py"
